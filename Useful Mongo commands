Heres a summary of useful commands you can run inside the mongo shell to get an idea of how your server is acting.
These can be scripted so you can pull out some values and chart or monitor them if you want.

db.currentOp() - shows you all currently running operations
db.killOp(opid) - lets you kill long running queries
db.serverStatus() - shows you stats for the entire server, very useful for monitoring
db.stats() - shows you stats for the selected db
db.collection.stats() - stats for the specified collection


Monitoring commands
There are some pretty cool utilities that come with Mongo for monitoring your instances.

mongotop - shows how much time was spend reading or writing each collection over the last second
mongostat - brilliant live debug tool, gives a view on all your connected MongoDB instances
Monitoring frontends

MMS - 10genâ€™s hosted mongo monitoring service. Good starting point.
Kibana - Logstash frontend. Trend analysis for Mongo logs. Pretty useful for good visibility.
